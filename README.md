A website consisting of several main sections: a header with a logo and navigation menu, a main screen with a title and an action button, information blocks for presenting services or products, a section with reviews or a portfolio, and a footer with contact information and links to social networks. The structure of the site is built in such a way as to ensure a logical sequence of information presentation and user convenience during navigation.
